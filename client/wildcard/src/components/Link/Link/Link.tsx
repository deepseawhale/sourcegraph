/**
 * The component used to render a link. All shared code must use this component for linksâ€”not <a>, <Link>, etc.
 *
 * Different platforms (web app vs. browser extension) require the use of different link components:
 *
 * The web app uses <RouterLinkOrAnchor>, which uses react-router-dom's <Link> for relative URLs (for page
 * navigation using the HTML history API) and <a> for absolute URLs. The react-router-dom <Link> component only
 * works inside a react-router <BrowserRouter> context, so it wouldn't work in the browser extension.
 *
 * The browser extension uses <a> for everything (because code hosts don't generally use react-router). A
 * react-router-dom <Link> wouldn't work in the browser extension, because there is no <BrowserRouter>.
 *
 * This variable must be set at initialization time by calling {@link setLinkComponent}.
 *
 * The `to` property holds the destination URL (do not use `href`). If <a> is used, the `to` property value is
 * given as the `href` property value on the <a> element.
 *
